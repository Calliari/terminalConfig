# Instructions how to setup

1) Terminal configuration

To use this config file just clone this repo in the host  home directory,
make sure you are in the host user home directory, just use the command:

```
$ cd
```

If there is a file called '.bash_profile' this configuration can be copied from this repo from the 'bash_profile' file using coping and pasteing.

This can be done by cloning the repo wit the command bellow on the user home directory;

CHANGE DIRECTORY INTO '' REPO AFTER CLONED FROM GitHub
